**Project Description:**


For this university project, my group and I attempted to analyze and solve the task presented in the Kaggle challenge 'Contradictory, Dear Mr. Watson.' The task involved determining if two given sentences could entail each other, contradict each other, or be unrelated.

To accomplish this, we first experimented with various text preprocessing techniques such as removing stop words, lemmatization, stemming, and word and text vectorization, along with subsequent text analyses.

Finally, in order to tackle the task, we developed several machine learning models from different families, including classical machine learning estimators like random forest, naive Bayes, and SVMs, various deep learning models such as LSTM and CNN, and we also explored machine learning models that rely on attention mechanisms, particularly various models based on the BERT transformers.

For more technical details, we invite you to refer to the report and the accompanying code.
